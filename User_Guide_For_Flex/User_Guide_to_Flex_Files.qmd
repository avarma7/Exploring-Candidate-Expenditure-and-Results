knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
```
* The files that create a flex dashboard are: 
    + Flex_498_Project.rmd
    + Dashboard_pg_1.rmd
    + Dashboard_pg_2.rmd
    + Dashboard_pg_3.rmd
    
* Running any of these files will create a new folder with a cache
* To run these files:
    + The Base_Data.csv file must be in this folder/current working directory
    + Press the run document button, located where the render button would be in a quarto doc (or where the knit button whould be in an rmd file)
