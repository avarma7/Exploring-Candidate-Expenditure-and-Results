* To run the Data_Cleaning file it requires you to have the "Expenditures_by_Candidates_and_Political_Committees.csv" file on your own server (The file is over 300 MB and too big to load into git).
    + If you have the file you can run Data_Cleaning.qmd to overwrite the Base_Data.csv in this folder (all other files require a Base_Data.csv data set to run)
    + If you do not have the csv file there is a Base_Data.csv data set included 

    
### Note:
Running any dashboard or flex file will create a new folder with a cache
